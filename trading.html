  <h2>Trading: How to Start</h2>
  <hr>

  <h4>What is Trading?</h4>
  <p>
    Trading is the act of buying and selling financial assets like stocks, forex, or cryptocurrencies with the goal of making a profit.
    Unlike investing for the long-term, trading usually focuses on shorter periods to take advantage of price changes.
  </p>

  <h4>Step 1: Learn the Basics</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Stocks:</strong> Shares of a company you can buy and sell.</li>
    <li><strong>Forex:</strong> Buying and selling currency pairs like USD/EUR.</li>
    <li><strong>Crypto:</strong> Digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Key Terms:</strong> Bid, Ask, Spread, Leverage, Margin, Stop-loss, Take-profit.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Step 2: Choose a Trading Platform</h4>
  <p>
    A trading platform or broker is where you actually buy and sell. Here are some popular options:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Binance:</strong> Crypto trading platform</li>
    <li><strong>IQ Option:</strong> Beginner-friendly for stocks, forex, crypto</li>
    <li><strong>eToro:</strong> Social trading – you can copy trades from experts</li>
    <li><strong>MetaTrader 4/5:</strong> Advanced software for forex & CFD trading</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Step 3: Start Small</h4>
  <p>
    Before putting real money in, start with a demo account. Practice without risking anything.
    Once confident, start with small amounts.
  </p>

  <h4>Step 4: Develop a Strategy</h4>
  <p>Choose a style that fits your time and personality:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Day Trading:</strong> Buy and sell within a single day. Quick profits but high risk.</li>
    <li><strong>Swing Trading:</strong> Hold trades for several days or weeks. Moderate risk.</li>
    <li><strong>Long-Term Investing:</strong> Hold for months or years. Lower risk but slower gains.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Step 5: Risk Management</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Never invest money you can’t afford to lose.</li>
    <li>Use stop-loss orders to prevent big losses.</li>
    <li>Don’t trade based on emotions – stick to your plan.</li>
    <li>Diversify: don’t put all your money in one asset.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Step 6: Keep Learning</h4>
  <p>
    Markets change all the time. Read news, watch tutorials, follow expert traders, and review your trades regularly.
